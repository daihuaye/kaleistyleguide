# Getting Started

By default, Kalei uses `imports.css` as a base style sheet to import all the style sheets that you want to document.

This is how this particular `imports.css` looks like:

<pre data-src="css/imports.css"></pre>

See **Config.js** for more options.

# How to document your style sheets

## Kalei â™¥ Markdown

One of the great things about Kalei is that you can use the same style sheets you're using right now in your project.
How cool is that, right?

You just need to comment your style sheets using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
and then, boom...!! The magic happens!

You end up with a fully documented style sheet and a beautifully auto-generated living style guide.
Killing two (tofu) birds with one stone.
What a deal!

See more at [prism-demo.scss](#/examples/prism-demo.scss).

/*
# Config.js

As you can see, there are 3 ways (well, actually 2) to point at your style sheets:

1. Define `css_path` - This is the preferred way to go!
2. Define `css_path_url` - **Not supported yet!!!**
3. Define `css_paths` - Manually enter an array of files.

Just comment and uncomment the appropiate lines to make it work.

<pre data-src="js/config.js"></pre>
