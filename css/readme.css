# Generate bootstrap-like documentation for your own CSS!

This project aims at making sure your style sheets are fully documented whilst being synchronized with your project styles.

To do this, it actually uses your style sheets so that, at anytime, you can review how your style guide looks.

This website is a live example generated from Kalei's styles.

*/
/*
# Main goals and benefits

* Fully documented CSS - No need to explain the benefits.
* No dependencies, simply download the repository and run it in your browser.
* Automatic generation of demo UI components.
* Easy access for anyone: designers, developers, managers, users, etc.
* Rapid development of projects by allowing developers to find the correct CSS and HTML for any given UI component.
* Open sourced so that all great ideas can be included.

*/
/*
# Installation

1. Download the repository `git clone https://github.com/hiulit/kaleistyleguide.git`.
2. Serve it on a HTTP server (or a local environment using [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/),
 [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/), etc.) and it should work!

*/
/*
# Getting Started

By default, Kalei uses `imports.css` as a base style sheet to import all the style sheets that you want to document.

This is how this particular `imports.css` looks like:

<pre data-src="css/imports.css"></pre>

*/
/*
# How to document your style sheets

Comments ♥ Markdown

One of the great things about Kalei is that you can use the same style sheets you're using right now in your project.
How cool is that, right?

You just need to comment your style sheets using Markdown and then, boom...!! The magic happens!

You end up with a fully documented style sheet and a beautifully auto-generated living style guide. Killing two (tofu) birds with one stone.
What a deal!

# Example

Easily show off examples of your components and the HTML to generate them.

```markup
<div class="actions button-container">
	<a href="#" class="button primary">Compose new</a>
	<div class="button-group">
		<a href="#" class="button primary">Archive</a>
		<a href="#" class="button">Report spam</a>
		<a href="#" class="button danger">Delete</a>
	</div>
	<div class="button-group minor-group">
		<a href="#" class="button">Move to</a>
		<a href="#" class="button">Labels</a>
	</div>
</div>
```

## Notes

If you want to pimp your experience and leverage [sass.js](https://github.com/medialize/sass.js) and [Prism](http://prismjs.com/),
