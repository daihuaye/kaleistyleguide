# Handlebars.js

> Minimal templating on steroids.

[Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) is bundled with Phytoplankton.

# Example usage

Wrap your code with
[fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks) `` ``` `` +
`hbs`, like this:

	```hbs
	{ "template": "hello", "dataObject": "filtertabs" }
	```

Phytoplankton will automatically render the code as both HTML and the code block (both the Handlebars template and the HTML) with syntax highlighting.

```hbs
{ "template": "hello", "dataObject": "filtertabs" }
```
