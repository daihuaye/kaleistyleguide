# Handlebars.js

> Minimal templating on steroids.

[Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) is bundled with Phytoplankton.

# Example usage

Wrap your code with
[fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks) `` ``` `` +
`hbs`, like this:

	```hbs
	{ "template": "hello", "dataObject": "filtertabs" }
	```

Basically what you're doing is passing a **JSON Object** with 2 properties:

* `template`: The name of the template (stored in `templates/hbs/`).
* `dataObject`: The template context object (stored in `js/hbs-objects/mockup-objects.js`).

Here's how `mockup-objects.js` looks like.

<pre data-src="js/hbs-objects/mockup-objects.js"></pre>

Phytoplankton will automatically render the code as both HTML and the code blocks (uncompiled and compiled Handlebars) with syntax highlighting.

```hbs
{ "template": "hello", "dataObject": "filtertabs" }
```
